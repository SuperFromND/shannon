# What is this?
This is a template repository that I created to make it easier for me to start making small tools and projects involving SDL2 and C++. It contains:
- a basic but functional Makefile
- a built-in font and drawing function
- a Hello world! example using the above
# Building
You should be able to build this pretty easily as long as you have SDL2 and a C++ compiler ready to go.
```
git clone https://github.com/SuperFromND/example.git
cd example
make
make install // Windows users only!
```
